## What is elsciRL?

**elsciRL (pronounced L-SEE)** is an abbreviation of our mission: *"Everything can be automated using Language and Self-Completing Instructions in Reinforcement Learning"*.

To achieve this, **elsciRL** offers a novel framework and infrastructure for accelerating the development of language based Reinforcement Learning solutions.

## Quick-start

1. Install the Python library
```
pip install elsciRL
```
2. Run the demo experiment in a Python shell
```python
from elsciRL.examples.experiment import DemoExperiment
exp = DemoExperiment()
exp.run()
exp.analyze()
``` 
*This will run a Reinforcement Learning experiment on two simple problems (OpenAI Gym's FrozenLake and a Sailing Simulation).*

*The analyze function will return a combined chart for the experiments you just ran!*
