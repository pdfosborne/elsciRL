## Install Guide

### Quick Install

It is suggested to use a [Python environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#). 

Then, install the Python library from the PyPi package library:

```bash
pip install elsciRL
```

### Manual Install
Alternatively, you can clone this repository directly and install it manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL.git
cd elsciRL
pip install .
```

### Developer Install
If you wish wish to edit the software you can do this my installing it as an editable package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL.git
cd elsciRL
pip install -e .
```

<!-- ## Quick Demo

To check the install has worked, you can run a quick CLI demo from a selection of applications:

```python
from elsciRL import Demo
test = Demo()
test.run()
```

This will run a tabular Q learning agent on your selected problem and save results to:

> '*CURRENT_DIRECTORY*/elsciRL-EXAMPLE-output/...'

A help function is included in demo: *test.help()* -->


## GUI App

To run the App, run the following code in a Python script.

```python
from elsciRL import App
App.run()
```

This will give you a localhost link to open the App in a browser.

## What is elsciRL?

**elsciRL (pronounced L-SEE)** offers a general purpose Python library for accelerating the development of language based Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches.

Our novel solution is a two-phased approach.

First, we use adapters to introduce language with reduced setup requirements. For example, this may be in the form of a set of one-to-one mapping rules to more advanced prediction methods to transform environment states to language. 

Second, now that language exists in the problem space, we can then apply our unsupervised instruction following approach. Prior approaches required some form of human labelling efforts to complete instructions which can be costly to obtain. 

These combined define our **Explicit Language for Self-Completing Instruction** methodology, i.e. **elsci**.

Our solution allows end users to give instructions to Reinforcement Learning agents without direct supervision where prior methods required any objectives to be hard coded as rules or shown by demonstration (e.g. if key in inventory then objective reached). 

Our work fits within the scope of AI agents but we notably do not require the problem to already contain language which is normally required for applying LLMs.

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is an Artificial Intelligence methodology that teaches machines how to make decisions and perform actions to achieve a goal.

It's based on the idea that machines can learn from their experiences to automate a task without being told exactly what to do, similar to how humans learn through trial and error.

See the [FAQs](https://elsci.org/FAQs) for more information.
